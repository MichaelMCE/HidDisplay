    * DESCRIPTION OF THE FACE ARRAY
    * 
    * the array is composed of "chains" of triangles. Each chain starts with a 
    * uint16_t that specifies its length and is followed by a sequence of elements
    * where each element occupies 1, 2 or 3 uint16_t. So the array takes the following 
    * general form:
    * 
    * [chain 1 length = n] [elem 1] [elem 2] [elem 3]  ... [elem n+2]
    * [chain 2 length = m] [elem 1] [elem 2] [elem 3]  ... [elem m+2]
    *       ...
    * [chain k length = p] [elem 1] [elem 2] [elem 3]  ... [elem p+2]
    * [endtag = 0]
    *
    * - An endtag (int16_t)0 is used as a sentinel to mark the end of the array.
    *
    * - A chain starts with a single uint16_t [chain length] that specify
    * the number of triangles in the chain. It is followed  by [chain length]+2
    * "elements".
    *
    * A "element" represent a vertex of a triangle and occupies 1, 2 or 3 uint16_t
    * depending on wether the  textcoord and normal arrays exist. The first uint16_t
    * of an element is the vertex index (with the direction bit), possibly followed
    * by the texture index (if texture array is present) and then finally followed by
    * the normal index (if a normal array is present) i.e an element as the form:
    *
    *                         (if texture set) (if normal set)
    *    1bit     15bits          (16bits)        (16bits)
    *   [DBIT| VERTEX INDEX]  [TEXTURE INDEX]  [NORMAL INDEX]
    *
    * the highest bit of the first uint16_t is called the direction bit DBIT.
    * Thus, a vertex index is stored on only 15 bit which is why the vertex array
    * cannot contain more than 32767 indices.
    *
    * The first 3 elements of a chain represent the 3 vertices or the starting
    * triangle of the chain. Their DBIT is always 0. Each subsequent element
    * is combined with the current triangle to deduce the next triangle in the
    * following way.
    *
    * Say the current triangle is [V1, V2, V3] and the next element is DBIT|V4:
    *
    * if DBIT = 0, then the next triangle is [V1, V3, V4]
    * if DBIT = 1, then the next triangle is [V3, V2, V4]
    *
    * REMARK: the winding order of the triangle matters (for face culling)  and 
    * that is what the DBIT is for.
    * 
    * EXAMPLE: We assume that texcoord = nullptr but normal != nullptr so that
    * each element is coded on 2 uint16_t: the DBIT and vertex index on the first
    * uint16_t and the normal index on the second uint16_t.
    *
    * Let us consider the following face array composed of 19 uint16_t:
    *
    * face = {3,0,1,2,2,4,6,32773,8,7,7,1,8,7,9,4,5,5,0}
    *
    * It should be read as
    *
    * 3               (the first chain has 3 triangles)
    * 0/1   2/2  4/6  (first triangle with vertex 0,2,4 and normals 1,2,6)
    * 5/8             (32773 = 32768 + 5 so DBIT = 1, second triangle)
    * 7/7             (third triangle DBIT = 0)
    * 1               (the second chain has a single triangle)
    * 8/7   9/4  5/5  (the triangle of the second chain)
    * 0               (end tag)
    *
    * after decoding, this gives a list of 4 triangles
    * (with normals associated with each vertex index).
    *
    * 0/1   2/2  4/6
    * 4/6   2/2  5/8
    * 4/6   5/8  7/7
    * 8/7   9/4  5/5
    *

    /**
     * Helper method to create a "cache version" of a mesh by copying part of its data into fast
     * memory buffers. A typical scenario for using this method is when when using a MCU with
     * limited RAM and slow FLASH memory.
     * 
     * The method copy as much as it can into the given RAM1/RAM2 buffers but will leave the arrays
     * that are to big in their current place. The method never 'fails' but it may return the
     * original mesh if not caching is possible.
     * 
     * A C-string describe which arrays should be copied and in which order:
     * 
     * "V" = vertex array. 
     * "N" = normal array. 
     * "T" = texture array. 
     * "I" = texture image  
     * "F" = face arrays.
     * 
     * For example "VIT" means copy vertex arrays first, then image texture and finally texture
     * coord (if there is still room).
     * 
     * REMARKS: 
     *   1. the memory buffers supplied do NOT have to be be aligned, the method takes care of it.
     * 
     *   2. The method also caches the sub-meshes linked after this one.
     * 
     * @param           mesh        Pointer to the mesh to cache.
     * @param [in,out]  ram1_buffer pointer to the first memory buffer (should have the fastest access)
     * @param           ram1_size   size in bytes of the ram1 buffer.
     * @param [in,out]  ram2_buffer pointer to a second memory buffer, may be nullptr.
     * @param           ram2_size   size in bytes of the ram2 buffer or 0 if not supplied.
     * @param           copy_order  c string that describe which array should be copied and in which order
     * @param [in,out]  ram1_used   If non-null, the number of bytes ultimately used in ram1_buffer is put here. 
     * @param [in,out]  ram2_used   If non-null, the number of bytes ultimately used in ram2_buffer is put here. 
     *
     * @returns The cached mesh (or the initial mesh if nothing was cached).
